   *  |   => The alternation combinator, it parses successfully if either the left or right side match
   *  ~   => This combinator forms a sequential combination of it's operands (ex. a~b expects a followed by b)
   *  ~>  => This combinator says "ensure the left operand exists, but don't include it in the result"
   *  <~  => This combinator says "ensure the right operand exists, but don't include it in the result"
   *  ^^  => This combinator says "if parsed successfully, transform the result using the block on the right"
   *  rep => This combinator says "expect zero or more repetitions of X"
